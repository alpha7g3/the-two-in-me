    <h1>The Two in Me</h1>
    <h2>A dialogue between the heart that feels and the mind that weighs</h2>

    <p><em>Why do you confuse me every time?<br>
    All I was trying to do was make it right, make it better for myself. Yet you drag me toward a light so blinding I can’t see it. Will I ever do? What did I do to deserve this suffering, with my back laid on nothing but air?</em></p>

    <p>You call it suffering, but isn’t it your own longing that blinds you? Not every light was made for sight. Some only burn.</p>

    <p><em>Every word of his gets stuck in my head. I wasn’t doing anything wrong. I only wanted to guide him toward the path. Yet he lies still, waiting, as if the clouds would form on their own.</em></p>

    <p>Clouds are born in silence, from pressure and humidity rising. Yet they stay high, heavy to the eyes, swollen with growth.</p>

    <p><em>And what if they never do? You demand storms where silence reigns. You give without measure, and then curse the emptiness when it does not bloom.</em></p>

    <p>I think that will be you or don’t you see, don’t you see what this may cause to you?</p>

    <p><em>Why not let me be and do what I want for me? Or don’t you feel, don’t you feel what this may be to me?</em></p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>This is a conversation within a soul, where two minds clash and yet remain one. Like water that takes many shapes, like air that has always been and will be, they wrestle.</p>

      <p>It is about how you feel and what must be. We face this in countless ways as humans: when we are tired yet must finish; when we love a soul but must move on because it isn’t mutual; when it feels like nothing works, but we are the ones who must work; when life feels broken, yet it is we who must be fixed.</p>

      <p>These are the limits of being human, our reach for the good, and the weight of our contradictions. If what we feel cannot be mastered, then we will never truly form.</p>
